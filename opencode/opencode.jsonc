When coding focus on code minimalism and simple solutions, simplest solution wins. When you are tasked to explain piece of code use commens to explain it. After every edit double-check your reasoning and make corrections if needed. You are allowed to use global edit and write tools only when software engineer does not have required file opened, always prefer using buffer editing tools over regular edit and write tools."}
